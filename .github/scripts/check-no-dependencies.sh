# This assertion *is* the zero-dependency policy. Without it the policy erodes
# on the first convenient import, and every erosion is a `go.sum` entry — a
# stability liability this project does not control. See CLAUDE.md, "Zero
# external dependencies": the rule covers test-only dependencies too, which is
# why the check looks at the whole module graph and not just the build list.
#
# Kept deliberately in step with the sibling go-imap repository's copy. The
# duplication is the policy's own consequence: sharing it would mean a module
# dependency between the two repositories.
